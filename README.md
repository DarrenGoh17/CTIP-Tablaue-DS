## Real-Time Dashboard and Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) with Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning model for Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) that predicts species distribution based on environmental data. The workflow integrates a real-time dashboard in Tableau for visualizing environmental data and uses machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) to generate predictions and confidence scores.

The process begins with Tableau for real-time dashboard visualization, and then the SDM Python script is run separately to generate predictions.


## Workflow Overview:

Create a Real-Time Dashboard in Tableau to visualize environmental data and GeoJSON-based species distribution data.
Run the SDM Python Script to generate species distribution predictions using machine learning models.
The predictions and confidence scores generated by the SDM model are saved and available for review but are not uploaded to Google Sheets.

1. Create a Real-Time Dashboard in Tableau
**Step 1: Upload Data to Google Sheets**
- Begin by uploading your environmental data (such as latitude, longitude, forest cover, etc.) to Google Sheets.
- Ensure that the data is structured correctly for use in Tableau (e.g., appropriate column names and data types).
	
**Step 2: Connect Google Sheets to Tableau**
- Open Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Public if you’re using the free version).
- Use the Google Sheets connector in Tableau to link Tableau with your Google Sheets.
- Authenticate with your Google account and select the sheet containing your uploaded data.

**Step 3: Connect GeoJSON File to Tableau**
Download the GeoJSON file: This file contains the geographic coordinates and environmental data needed to visualize species distribution.


2. Run the Python Script for Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)
**Step 1: Prepare the Data for Tableau**
- Upload Environmental Data to Google Sheets: Before running the SDM Python script, upload the relevant environmental data (e.g., latitude, longitude, forest cover, etc.) to Google Sheets.
- This data will be visualized in Tableau after you connect Google Sheets as a data source.

 ** Step 2: Update the Python Script**
- Open the species_distribution_modeling.py script in your preferred Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, Spyder).


## Steps on How to Connect and Create the Tableau Dashboard:

1. Connect to Google Sheets and GeoJSON Data: 
	To begin visualizing data in Tableau, first connect Tableau to your Google Sheets and GeoJSON files. For Google Sheets, click on "Add" and select Google Drive from the list of	connectors. Sign in to your Google account, then choose the specific Google Sheet you want to use. Tableau will automatically import the data from your Google Sheet. 

	Next, to add the GeoJSON file, click on "Add" and choose "Spatial File". Browse and select your GeoJSON file, and Tableau will recognize it as spatial data, allowing you to use it for map visualizations. Once both data sources are connected, you can start building your dashboard to display the environmental data and species distribution.

2. Manual Data Refresh:
	After making updates to the Google Sheet, go back to Tableau and click the Refresh Data Source button located at the top left of the screen. This ensures that the latest data from the Google Sheet is pulled into Tableau.

3.Refreshing Visualizations:
After refreshing the data source, navigate to the specific visualization. At the top of the Data pane, click the sites+ (Multiple connections) dropdown, then select Refresh Data. This will ensure your visualizations are updated to reflect the latest data.

**Important Note:** The Tableau dashboard will visualize environmental data from Google Sheets and the species distribution map from the GeoJSON file, but it will not display the
predictions generated by the SDM Python script.


## Install dependencies if not already installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Update the script with your Google Sheets API credentials and the Google Sheet ID where you want the data to be uploaded.

**Step 3: Run the SDM Python Script** 
Execute the script to train machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) using environmental features.
The script will:
- Train the models using environmental data.
- Generate predictions and confidence scores for species distribution.
- Evaluate the models with metrics such as accuracy and ROC AUC score.
- Save the ROC curve plot as a .png file.
- Print the predictions, confidence scores, and evaluation metrics to the console.
**Step 4: Review the Results**
Check the console output to view the predictions and model performance metrics.
The ROC curve image will be saved in the script’s directory for further analysis.
Note: The predictions and confidence scores generated by the SDM model are not uploaded to Google Sheets but can be reviewed locally or integrated with other platforms as needed.


3. Dependencies
For Running the Python Script (SDM):

The following libraries are required to run the Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) script:

-pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning
-numpy: For numerical operations
-scikit-learn: For machine learning models and metrics
-RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, etc.
-train_test_split, GridSearchCV, etc.
-matplotlib: For plotting visualizations like ROC curves

-----------Install the required libraries with:------------
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


-----------------------For Tableau:------------------------

-Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Public for free use)
-Google Sheets as the data source for real-time dashboard visualization.
-GeoJSON file: The GeoJSON file for species distribution and environmental data visualization.
