## Real-Time Dashboard and Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) with Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning model for Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) that predicts species distribution based on environmental data. The workflow integrates a real-time dashboard in Tableau for visualizing environmental data and uses machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) to generate predictions and confidence scores.

The process begins with Tableau for real-time dashboard visualization, and then the SDM Python script is run separately to generate predictions.


## Workflow Overview

Create a Real-Time Dashboard in Tableau to visualize environmental data and GeoJSON-based species distribution data.
Run the SDM Python Script to generate species distribution predictions using machine learning models.
The predictions and confidence scores generated by the SDM model are saved and available for review but are not uploaded to Google Sheets.

1. Create a Real-Time Dashboard in Tableau
	-Step 1: Upload Data to Google Sheets
	Begin by uploading your environmental data (such as latitude, longitude, forest cover, etc.) to Google Sheets.
	Ensure that the data is structured correctly for use in Tableau (e.g., appropriate column names and data types).
	
	-Step 2: Connect Google Sheets to Tableau
	Open Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Public if you’re using the free version).
	Use the Google Sheets connector in Tableau to link Tableau with your Google Sheets.
	Authenticate with your Google account and select the sheet containing your uploaded data.

	-Step 3: Connect GeoJSON File to Tableau
	Download the GeoJSON file: This file contains the geographic coordinates and environmental data needed to visualize species distribution.


## Link GeoJSON to Tableau

In Tableau, select GeoJSON as your data source.
Load the GeoJSON file (it contains the species' geographical coordinates).
This file will be used for the map visualization in Tableau, showing species distribution across different locations.


## Create the Tableau Dashboard

Use Tableau to build a real-time dashboard that visualizes the data from Google Sheets and the GeoJSON-based map.
Configure auto-refresh or manual refresh settings in Tableau, depending on your needs.
Note: The Tableau dashboard will visualize environmental data from Google Sheets and the species distribution map from the GeoJSON file, but it will not display the predictions generated by the SDM Python script.


1. Run the Python Script for Species Distribution Modeling (SDM)
- Step 1: Prepare the Data for Tableau
  Upload Environmental Data to Google Sheets: Before running the SDM Python script, upload the relevant environmental data (e.g., latitude, longitude, forest cover, etc.) to Google Sheets.
  This data will be visualized in Tableau after you connect Google Sheets as a data source.
- Step 2: Update the Python Script
  Open the species_distribution_modeling.py script in your preferred Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, Spyder).


## Install dependencies if not already installed

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Update the script with your Google Sheets API credentials and the Google Sheet ID where you want the data to be uploaded.

1. Run the SDM Python Script
  Execute the script to train machine learning models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) using environmental features.
  The script will:
  Train the models using environmental data.
  Generate predictions and confidence scores for species distribution.
  Evaluate the models with metrics such as accuracy and ROC AUC score.
  Save the ROC curve plot as a .png file.
  Print the predictions, confidence scores, and evaluation metrics to the console.
2. Review the Results
  Check the console output to view the predictions and model performance metrics.
  The ROC curve image will be saved in the script’s directory for further analysis.
  Note: The predictions and confidence scores generated by the SDM model are not uploaded to Google Sheets but can be reviewed locally or integrated with other platforms as needed.


## Dependencies
For Running the Python Script (SDM):

The following libraries are required to run the Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) script:

	-pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning
	-numpy: For numerical operations
	-scikit-learn: For machine learning models and metrics
	-RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, etc.
	-train_test_split, GridSearchCV, etc.
	-matplotlib: For plotting visualizations like ROC curves

-----------Install the required libraries with:------------
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


-----------------------For Tableau:------------------------

	-Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Public for free use)
	-Google Sheets as the data source for real-time dashboard visualization.
	-GeoJSON file: The GeoJSON file for species distribution and environmental data visualization.
